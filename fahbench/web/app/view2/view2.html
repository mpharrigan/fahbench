        <p>
            FAHBench evaluates the performance of OpenCL devices (like GPUs)
            using the OpenMM molecular dynamics program. The computational core
            of FAHBench is nearly identical to Folding@home scientific "cores"
            that allow donors from around the world to donate computations to
            solving novel problems in biophysics. A higher score in FAHBench
            means more effective computations for Folding@home.
